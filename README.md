# Scripting For Games

This is a repository of homeworks and projects made for Scripting for Games. 

Homeworks are here for later reference, but based on the assignment they often use things like other peoples' (CC0) assets, or code not written by myself. For that reason, only the projects will get releases. Even in the projects, some CC0 sounds and standard assets were used, but all the code I wrote will always be in the Assets/Scripts folder.

I named each assignment start using the letters of the alphabet, in order, for the first letter of the assignment. That is, the assignment that starts with "C" would be the third assigmnet, and so on.

The projects are Incarcerated, Questable, and {To be determined}.
